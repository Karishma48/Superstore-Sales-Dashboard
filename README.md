# Superstore-Sales-Dashboard
Hello everyone, I hope all is well with you! ðŸŽŸ ðŸš€

wonderful news! I'm thrilled to introduce my newest project, the Superstore Sales Dashboard, which was painstakingly made with the amazing Power BI tool. âœ¨


This dashboard is a treasure trove of information about the performance of our store, highlighting important indicators like foot traffic from customers, overall sales, the top and bottom 5 products, and sales by segment. These data are beautifully shown using a fun mix of dynamic line charts and donut charts.

The process started with gathering data from the reliable Kaggle website. From then on, I had to put on my work gloves and get down to business, carefully cleaning the dataset, creating critical KPIs, and carrying out operations that would change the world.

 An attractive dashboard with well-considered, informative line charts
